We currently have the bone picker and highlighting working at specific angles (like 
the initial starting position). When hovering over a bone, the bone highlights as
yellow. However, it does not work for many camera rotations.

For this week, Daniel will continue working on the bone picker to highlight at 
these different rotations/angles. Ethan is starting to work on writing the code for updating
the skeleton after dragging a bone.
